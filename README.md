# Bitcoin-Data-Analysis

Bitcoin (BTC) is a consensus network that enables a new payment system and a fully digital currency. Powered by its users, it peers into a payment network that does not require a central authority to operate.The dataset used in the above project was downloaded from kaggle.I have used this data to the full potential to bring out insightful plots and conclusions.I had cleaned the dataset uing pandas library from python.I had gained knowledge on different types of plots such as candlestick plots and line plots through this project.The candlestick plot used in the above project focusses mainly on the open,close,high and low values of the bitcoins from 2013 to 2017.
